## About the application - Todo's

Everyone's so busy! We'd like an application to track everyone on our team's tasks that's intuitive, elegant, and fun to use. Your task is to build that experience for us and code it up using your favorite front end framework. You have the following [user stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) to go on:

1. As a user, I should be able to view a page with a task list on it.
2. As a user, I should be able to add a new task to the global task list.
3. As a user, I should be able to remove a task from the global task list.
4. As a user, I should be able to reorder a task in the task list.
5. As a user, I should be able to edit the name of a task in the task list.
6. As a user, I should be able to mark a task in the list as completed.

A task is simply defined as a small piece of work with a description and can exist in one of two simple states: completed or not completed. As for the list, consider it empty any time someone first visits your index page; you don't have to worry about saving the state of your application between uses.

### Architecture

1. Implement front end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required. If you're familiar with engines like Yeoman, Gulp, or Grunt that you use them to orchestrate your front end engineering process.
2. Implement back end with NodeJs, Express. Data layer can be flat JSON files or tiny node.js running express or something similar.
