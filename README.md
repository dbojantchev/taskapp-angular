## About the application - Todo's

Below is a simple ToDo application that we would like to you build, Following are the [user stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories):

1. As a user, I should be able to view a page with a task list on it.
2. As a user, I should be able to add a new task to the global task list.
3. As a user, I should be able to remove a task from the global task list.
4. As a user, I should be able to reorder a task in the task list.
5. As a user, I should be able to edit the name of a task in the task list.
6. As a user, I should be able to mark a task in the list as completed.

A task is simply defined as a small piece of work with a description and can exist in one of two simple states: completed or not completed. As for the list, consider it empty any time someone first visits your index page; you don't have to worry about saving the state of your application between uses.

### How to start

2. Solve the problem below, checking in to your fork as you go as if this were a real project you're working on. Note that we're also testing your familiarty with GIT and your workflow. We will look at your commit history closely.
3. Submit a pull request back to this repository with your solution when finished.

### Architecture

1. Implement front end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required. You can use any Templating engines you are familiar with (Example: Handlebars or EJS). If you prefer, you can use Angular too. 
2. Implement back end with NodeJs, Express. Data layer can be flat JSON files or MongoDb. 
3. If you're familiar with Task runners like Gulp or Grunt use them to orchestrate your front end engineering process.
4. Make sure you have implemented unit tests with your choice of framework (Example: Jasmine or Mocha).
